Currently, any link on facebook has the href `https://l.facebook.com/u=LINK` rather than just `LINK`.
This is a WebExtension which fixes these links.

## Installation (for Firefox)

You need to have the Developer Edition or the Nightly for this. You can use `about:debugging` to Enable Add-on Debugging and then Load a Temporary Add On by selecting the `manifest.json` here.

There is an easier way, by using the Install Addon From File inside `about:addons`. You need an XPI file for this which is available on request.
